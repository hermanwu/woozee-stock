In this way, it actually is like a human. It makes mistakes. It changes its “mind.” It can be fairly arbitrary.\n\nEssentially, GPT-4 arranges vast, unstructured arrays of human knowledge and expression into a more connected and interoperable network, thus amplifying humanity’s ability to compound its collective ideas and impact.',
